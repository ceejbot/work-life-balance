# [fit] work-life
# [fit] __balance__ at npm

---

# [fit] or, why I __hate__ the term
# [fit] "work-life balance"
# [fit] & what this __means__ at npm

---

# [Buzzfeed on Uber's culture](https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/how-ubers-hard-charging-corporate-culture-left-employees)

"impossible workloads, around-the-clock emergencies, fear of management, a total erosion of work-life balance, and a pattern of public humiliation at the hands of higher-ups"

---

# [fit] this article made me __angry__
# [fit] maybe even __A N G E R Y__

---

# [fit] ceej __anger__ boxes checked

* 12 hour days __✔__
* 7 day a week __✔__
* abuse from management __✔__
* constant emergencies __✔__

---

# [fit] the __research__ is clear:
# [fit] this isn't just __inhumane__
# [fit] it's also __stupid__

---

# [fit] "Why __crunch modes__
# [fit] don't work: 6 lessons"

http://www.igda.org/?page=crunchsixlessons

---

# the opening

"There's a bottom-line reason most industries gave up crunch mode over 75 years ago: It's the single most expensive way there is to get the work done."

"More than a century of studies show that long-term useful worker output is maximized near a five-day, 40-hour workweek. Productivity drops immediately upon starting overtime and continues to drop until, at approximately eight 60-hour weeks, the total work done is the same as what would have been done in eight 40-hour weeks."

---

# [fit] 5-day 40-hour work weeks
# [fit] were chosen for peak __efficiency__

^ America's robber barons were in it to make money, not to be altruists.

---

# [fit] __tech__ is not a magical exception
# [fit] __you__ are not a magical exception

---

# [fit] __programmers__ seem best
# [fit] around __35__ hrs/week

^ possibly it's the other way: the productivity peak happens at shorter times

---

# [fit] you might think you're __helping__
# [fit] __guilt__ might push you into overwork
# [fit] but you're __not__ doing your best work

^ I wish to crush my enemies & drive them before me, but unlike Uber I can't afford to waste money doing it. I need to do it intelligently.

---

# [fit] deny human biology
# [fit] at your __peril__

---

# [fit] note a lurking fact:
# [fit] __brief__ bursts can be effective!

---

# [fit] it's just that we turn __bursts__
# [fit] into __crunches__ into __death marches__

---

# [fit] the fact that __"death march"__ exists as
# [fit] a __term of art__ in project management
# [fit] is pretty __horrifying__

---

# [fit] __Uber__ is an extreme example
# [fit] but this is common behavior in tech

---

# [fit] [jwz rants](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-to-sell-a-con/): watch a __VC__
# [fit]  use my name to sell a __con__

^ Arrington uses the Netscape fairy story & jwz's account to sell overwork to other young engineers

---

# [fit] jwz __slept under his desk__
# [fit] in 1994 to ship Netscape

^ jwz points out that the people who made the real $ from Netscape did not sleep under their desks


---

# [fit] managers demanding __burnout__
# [fit] are attempting to __exploit__ you

^ but the thing is, I think these managers are *stupid*

---

# [fit] I __reject the premise__
# [fit] __burnout__ results in neither
# [fit] speed nor excellence

^ The research is not controversial.

---

# [fit] you don't run __marathon__ distances
# [fit] at Usain Bolt __sprint__ speeds

---

# [fit] __sprinting__ is sometimes right!
# [fit] for npm right now, it's __wrong__
# [fit] npm is a marathon

^ Netscape 1.0 sprint; today's Mozilla is a marathon

---

# [fit] __humans__ are npm's biggest investment
# [fit] far more than servers & bandwidth

^ It takes six months to make a programmer deeply effective in a large project.

---

# [fit] we need each other at our __best__
# [fit] our most __creative__, our most __skillful__

---

# [fit] and that means we need each other
# [fit] __rested, refreshed, recreated__

---

# [fit] our mission:
# [fit] take npm to the __stars__
# [fit] on a __budget__
# [fit] we can't afford Uber-level

^ npm could run for 200 years on the $ Uber burns in a single quarter; VCs have not given us billions

---

# [fit] you bring to npm
# [fit] your **previous** experiences
# [fit] including this **crunch or else** habit

---

# [fit] my __experience__ taught me
# [fit] to bring something else to npm

---

# [fit] npm's values unite
# [fit] __kindness__ and __pragmatism__

---

# [fit] __talk__ of values is all very well;
# [fit] how is this shown in our __behavior__?

---

# [fit] let's talk about __vacations__

---

# [fit] why have __fixed__ vacation days?

---

# [fit] "unlimited vacation"
# [fit] means "__untracked__ vacation"
# [fit] which often means
# [fit] pressure __not to take vacation__

---

# [fit] my usual joke is that your vacation
# [fit] is a __mandatory minimum__

^ I am the worst at this. I admit it.

---

# [fit] use __all__ your vacation

^ preferably spread out through the year

---

# [fit] let's talk about __sleep__

---

# [fit] if there's a Bateson's pyramid
# [fit] of human needs,
# [fit] __sleep is the base__

---

# [fit] ceej story time:
# [fit] how __2am decisions__ made
# [fit] the Danger SAN disaster worse

---

# [fit] management needed to __appear__
# [fit] to be engaged & involved

^ a lot of the long hours people put in are not spent working; they're spent *appearing* to be engaged

---

# [fit] __never__ make decisions
# [fit] on that little sleep

---

# [fit] you can do mechanical, __habitual__ things
# [fit] while __sleep-deprived__

---

# [fit] don't try __complex cognitive tasks__
# [fit] while __sleep-deprived__

---

# [fit] this lesson affects how we
# [fit] designed npm's __operations__

---

# [fit] npm does not need you to
# [fit] __appear__ to do lots of work
---

# [fit] npm does need you to
# [fit] **accomplish** good work

---

# [fit] let's talk about __balance__

---

# [fit] ceej story time:
# [fit] the General Magic
# [fit] __2am company meeting__

^ sony magic link release build test party; decision to release was forced, not changed by any testing

---

# [fit] the meeting felt __normal__
# [fit] narrator voice: it was not

^ hilariously, at the same time jwz was sleeping under his desk, I was doing this

---

# [fit] deeply imbalanced

^ it accomplished nothing; pointless sleepless work is far worse than useless

---

# [fit] why do I hate the phrase
# [fit] __"work-life balance"__?
# [fit] I reject the __premise__

---

# [fit] our work & our lives affect each other
# [fit] we're __whole human beings__

---

# [fit] our __work__ matters to us
# [fit] we want it to be __fulfilling__
# [fit] emotionally & intellectually

---

# [fit] we __need__ to do our work well

* * *

# [fit] we still want to **do good work**
# [fit] and make **awesome things**
# [fit] but we want to do this **effectively**

---

# [fit] what balance means is __individual__
# [fit] and will __vary__ over your lifetime

---

# [fit] a __weekend__ spent hacking is
# [fit] sometimes __refreshing__
# [fit] sometimes __exhausting__
# [fit] only you know which

---

# [fit] if npm __demands__ a weekend from you
# [fit] it will be in a __dire emergency__
# [fit] and the 3Cs will be there too

---

# [fit] then I'll run a __retro__ to figure out
# [fit] how to __avoid emergencies__ like that
# [fit] so it never happens again

---

# [fit] __selfish__ goal:
# [fit] help npm win

---

# [fit] __altruistic__ goal:
# [fit] be kind to our colleagues

---

# [fit] these two goals __align__ when we
# [fit] balance work & life

---

# [fit] the __winning__ strategy is
# [fit] the __kind__ strategy

^ the choice is obvious

---

# [fit] I can't stop you overworking
# [fit] you're all __adults__

---

# [fit] all I can do is explain
# [fit] why it's __not effective__

^ Please don't do an end run around us, thinking you're compensating for our kindness. you're not. we know what we're doing here.

---

# [fit] if you need to burst, __burst__
# [fit] please __rest__ after you burst

---

# [fit] be with your __loved ones__
# [fit] pursue your __hobbies__
# [fit] take __vacations__
# [fit] get plenty of __sleep__

---

# [fit] npm should be a place where you can
# [fit] do the __best work__ of your career thus far
# [fit] and take npm __to the stars__

^ This is my selfish personal goal. I want every one of you to look back & say this, and then take that attitude on to your next jobs.

# [fit] npm ❤️ your humanity
